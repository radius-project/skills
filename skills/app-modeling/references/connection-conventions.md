# Connection Conventions

## What a connection does

A `Radius.Compute/containers` connection declares a generic Radius relationship to another resource. It can project resource properties into the workload, but it does **not** translate them into arbitrary names or formats expected by an application.

Connection projection is version-specific. Depending on the Radius/container schema and recipe, a connection may provide:

- a `CONNECTION_<NAME>_PROPERTIES` JSON value;
- individual `CONNECTION_<NAME>_<PROPERTY>` values;
- relationship metadata; and/or
- no sensitive outputs.

Inspect the exact configured extension, registered resource schema, recipe output mapping, and Radius runtime before relying on any projection shape. Do not infer it from a different version's documentation.

## Decide wiring from source

For every dependency:

1. Inspect source, entrypoint, compose, and configuration files for the exact values the workload reads.
2. Record the selected profile's required names, casing, defaults, types, literal values, URL/config syntax, endpoint transformations, and secret handling.
3. Inspect the exact resource outputs and connection projection supplied by the target schema and recipe.
4. Prove the full client tuple: subresource, complete endpoint, port, protocol/version, TLS, auth mechanism, secret, and final source-supported format.
5. Select the wiring for each app-native value:
   - explicit `env.value` from a verified nonsecret output or literal;
   - `valueFrom.secretKeyRef` from an exact secret/key;
   - runtime composition; or
   - generic connection projection only when the source explicitly consumes that applicable contract.

An unmodified third-party image usually expects its own native variables or configuration. A connection alone does not configure it unless its source already understands the projected `CONNECTION_*` contract. A provider-specific `host` output may also require a documented suffix, port, TLS mode, or auth block before it is a usable client endpoint.

## Source consumes the generic contract

When the application explicitly parses the exact projection supplied by the target Radius version, or the selected profile explicitly requires Radius relationship metadata, declare the relationship with the required key:

```bicep
connections: {
  database: {
    source: database.id
  }
}
```

`connections` is a top-level object map under container resource `properties`, not inside an individual container.

## Source expects native configuration

Map every required input to the exact name the source consumes:

```bicep
containers: {
  api: {
    image: apiImage.properties.imageReference
    env: {
      APP_DB_HOST: {
        value: database.properties.host
      }
      APP_DB_PASSWORD: {
        valueFrom: {
          secretKeyRef: {
            secretName: databaseRuntimeSecret.name
            key: 'password'
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This is a representative pattern, not a required variable naming scheme. Confirm that `host`, the secret resource, and its key exist in the exact schemas. Direct resource and secret references create dependency ordering, so a connection is not required merely to order deployment.

Keep a connection alongside native variables when the source consumes generic values or the selected profile explicitly requires Radius relationship metadata. Explicit native variables are not categorically forbidden just because generic projection exists. Ensure duplicate names do not carry conflicting values.

## Provider-backed abstractions

The Radius type name describes developer intent; the selected recipe defines the concrete service contract. Resolve the application client against that concrete contract:

- confirm the provider's wire protocol and select the matching source adapter;
- transform namespace or account outputs into the complete endpoint only as the recipe and provider require;
- bind every schema-declared managed secret directly from its exact secret name and key; and
- inspect the secret value format before deciding how the application consumes it.

For example, an Azure recipe can implement `Radius.Messaging/rabbitMQ` with Azure Service Bus. Service Bus speaks AMQP 1.0, not RabbitMQ's AMQP 0-9-1 protocol. Its `connectionString` is a provider string such as `Endpoint=...;SharedAccessKeyName=...;SharedAccessKey=...`, not an AMQP URL. A workload that expects separate AMQP endpoint and SASL fields must bind the managed connection string to a helper with `secretKeyRef`, extract the proved fields at runtime, and use the source's AMQP 1.0 adapter. Never read `CONNECTION_<NAME>_CONNECTIONSTRING` when the selected schema declares that value only under managed-secret metadata, even if a mutable or older extension exposes a direct property with the same name.

## Rules

1. Never assume a connection invents app-specific variables, URLs, credentials, database names, or protocol settings.
2. Never assume one universal JSON or scalar `CONNECTION_*` projection. Verify the target version.
3. Sensitive outputs may be omitted from generic projection. Resolve and bind them through the exact secret contract described in [secrets-handling.md](secrets-handling.md).
   A sensitive app-native key must use an explicit `secretKeyRef` even when its name looks exactly like `CONNECTION_<NAME>_<PROPERTY>`; the matching connection does not project the secret. Bind a recipe-generated value directly from schema-declared managed-secret metadata, never through an authored wrapper or guessed resource property.
4. Reference a nonsecret read-only output only when the exact schema exposes it and the configured recipe populates it. Do not **set** read-only properties.
5. Use `disableDefaultEnvVars` only on the connection entry, only when the exact container schema supports it, and only when generic projection would conflict with the application.
6. Treat case, number-to-string conversion, URL encoding, TLS mode, and protocol-specific formatting as part of the app's runtime contract.
7. Preserve exact relationship names and provider/runtime values supplied by an explicit compatible profile; do not normalize them to generic defaults.
8. Do not count a connected resource as used unless the selected feature path consumes its projection or explicit native wiring.
9. A field named `connectionString` is opaque provider data until its grammar and the application's accepted input format are proved. Never pass it directly to a URL, password, host, or native connection field by name alone.
