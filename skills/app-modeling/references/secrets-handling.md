# Secrets and Credentials

Secret behavior is part of the exact resource type, extension, recipe, and container contract. Do not copy a secret path or key from another type or version.

## Resolve the contract first

For every secret, inspect:

1. the exact registered resource schema for sensitive input properties, secret references, read-only outputs, and key names;
2. the configured recipe's parameters and output mapping;
3. the exact `Radius.Security/secrets` and `Radius.Compute/containers` schemas for authored-secret and `secretKeyRef` support; and
4. the application source for the final native variable/configuration name and required format.

Preserve any explicit profile requirement that a recipe-generated or genuine application secret reach a particular native key through `secretKeyRef`. Binding it under a helper name does not satisfy a workload that reads the required key directly. A developer-supplied credential remains a direct `@secure()` `env.value` binding.

Never hardcode passwords, tokens, keys, or credential-bearing URLs. Use a `@secure()` parameter for developer-supplied Bicep inputs. Radius carries a `@secure()` parameter to a sensitive resource property and, when the parameter is assigned to a container `env.value`, injects it into the container without materializing it into plain state.

## Developer-supplied secret inputs

Follow the exact resource schema:

- If it defines an `x-radius-sensitive` property such as `password`, set that property from a `@secure()` parameter.
- If it defines a secret reference such as `secretName`, author the supported secret resource and reference it exactly as the schema requires.
- If it defines no credential input, do not invent one.

When the application container also needs that developer-supplied credential (for example, it reads `MYSQL_PASSWORD`), assign the same `@secure()` parameter directly to the container's `env.value`. Radius encrypts the parameter and injects it into the container, so do not author a `Radius.Security/secrets` wrapper for a value you already hold as a parameter, and do not route it through `secretKeyRef`. A sensitive resource *input* is not readable back from the resource, so supply the value to the app from the same parameter:

```bicep
@secure()
param password string

resource mysql 'Radius.Data/mySqlDatabases@2025-08-01-preview' = {
  name: 'mysql'
  properties: {
    environment: environment
    application: app.id
    username: 'myadmin'
    password: password
  }
}

resource apiContainer 'Radius.Compute/containers@2025-08-01-preview' = {
  name: 'api'
  properties: {
    environment: environment
    application: app.id
    containers: {
      api: {
        image: apiImage.properties.imageReference
        env: {
          MYSQL_PASSWORD: {
            value: password
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The names above are illustrative. Confirm the resource properties, app-native variable name, and required value format against the exact target contract and source. For a recipe-generated managed-secret output (below), bind it with `secretKeyRef` to the recipe's managed secret via `<resource>.properties.secrets.name`; do not author a wrapper secret. Reserve an authored `Radius.Security/secrets` resource for genuine application secrets/config files or a type whose schema requires `secretName`.

## Recipe-generated secret outputs

Some recipes generate sensitive values such as access keys, URLs, or connection strings. Their contract varies:

- a schema version may expose a managed-secret reference and declared secret keys;
- another version may use a different output shape or key names; or
- the configured recipe may not expose the value in a form containers can bind.

When the exact schema and recipe declare managed-secret metadata, that is the only supported projection path:

```bicep
APP_API_KEY: {
  valueFrom: {
    secretKeyRef: {
      secretName: service.properties.secrets.name
      key: 'apiKey'
    }
  }
}
```

The names are illustrative. `<resource>.properties.secrets.name` identifies the managed `Radius.Security/secrets` resource, while other fields declared under `<resource>.properties.secrets` name keys stored in that resource. They are metadata, not secret values readable from `service.properties.apiKey` or `service.properties.secrets.apiKey`.

Bind a complete managed URL/connection string directly to the app-native key when its format matches the pinned source. Radius itself materializes recipe secret outputs into the managed `Radius.Security/secrets` and populates the read-only `<resource>.properties.secrets.name`, so the app definition never authors, names, or duplicates that resource; it only binds to it by reference. Never create an authored `Radius.Security/secrets` wrapper whose `data` copies a recipe-generated value from a resource property. An authored secret is not an adapter for a missing or different output shape.

Do not assume one universal `properties.secrets` path or guess a key. If the exact schema/recipe does not expose the required managed-secret reference and key, report the gap. If a mutable compiled extension disagrees with that exact contract, report version drift rather than inventing a convenience property or wrapper.

If the exact contract cannot deliver a required secret by reference, report the schema/recipe gap rather than placing it in plain state.

A conflicting mutable extension is not evidence that the target Recipe's managed secret will appear as a direct property or in generic connection variables. Never remove a verified nested `secretKeyRef` to satisfy stale metadata. Resolve a compatible immutable extension or fail closed.

## Runtime composition

Applications often require one URL or config value that embeds a secret. Bicep interpolation would materialize the combined value before the container starts, so prefer runtime composition:

1. Bind the secret into a helper environment variable: from the `@secure()` parameter via `env.value` for a developer-supplied credential, or via `secretKeyRef` from `<resource>.properties.secrets.name` for a recipe-generated output.
2. Bind nonsecret host, port, database, and username values from verified outputs or literals.
3. Declare the helper before dependent values when the runtime requires ordering.
4. Compose the final app-native value in the container runtime or let the application construct it. The final key and syntax must exactly match the selected pinned-source contract.

For a non-URL format, the pattern can look like:

```bicep
env: {
  DB_PASSWORD: {
    value: password // developer-supplied @secure() parameter
  }
  APP_DATABASE_OPTIONS: {
    // mysql is the database resource symbol; substitute your actual resource
    value: 'host=${mysql.properties.host};password=$(DB_PASSWORD)'
  }
}
```

Kubernetes expands `$(VAR_NAME)` only from variables declared earlier in the environment list. Confirm the exact container recipe preserves this order, and preserve escaping through Bicep and any shell/config layer. Confirm the image has every shell or utility used by an entrypoint wrapper.

Credentials embedded in URLs must be URL-encoded. Kubernetes variable expansion does not encode them; use application logic or a verified runtime helper. If safe encoding cannot be guaranteed, do not generate a fragile connection string.

Do not assume an unconstrained developer-supplied password is URL-safe, recommend a restricted character set as a workaround, or treat shell expansion as encoding. Prefer source-native decomposed host, port, database, username, password, and TLS flags or fields when the application safely assembles the final client value.

### Authored secrets are not composition engines

`Radius.Security/secrets` can carry an exact application secret, but it does not turn Bicep interpolation into runtime composition. Never manufacture an aggregate credential-bearing URL or configuration in authored `data.value`, regardless of whether its other parts come from outputs, parameters, variables, or literals.

When the application accepts only one credential-bearing value, choose one proven path:

1. Bind an exact, source-compatible connection string from schema-declared managed-secret metadata.
2. Bind the parts separately and use a verified application, entrypoint, or helper that safely encodes and composes them at runtime.

If neither path exists, report the schema/application contract gap and do not emit a definition described as deployable.

## Checklist

- The input property, secret resource, managed-secret path, and key all exist in the exact configured schemas and recipe.
- Every container variable uses the exact native name and format read by source.
- Every developer-supplied `@secure()` parameter used by the application reaches its exact native key through direct `env.value`, without an authored wrapper secret.
- Recipe-generated secrets bind directly from the exact declared managed-secret name and key.
- No authored secret `data.value` references a recipe resource output or guessed convenience property.
- No authored secret `data.value` interpolates an aggregate credential-bearing URL/config.
- No secret is hardcoded, assumed URL-safe, or assumed to appear in generic connection variables.
- A developer-supplied `@secure()` value flows only through schema-sensitive properties or direct container `env.value`, never through a wrapper secret or `secretKeyRef`.
- `secretKeyRef` binds a recipe-generated value only through the owner's exact read-only managed-secret name/key. It may also consume an authored `Radius.Security/secrets`, which is allowed only for genuine application secrets/config files or a type whose schema requires `secretName`, never to wrap a recipe output.
- Runtime composition preserves dependency order, escaping, encoding, and image entrypoint behavior.
- A final credential-bearing URL/config is bound from a matching managed secret or safely composed at runtime; it is never reconstructed in Bicep or an authored secret.
